# **Case Study: Service A & Service B**

## **mvn clean package**

## **Overview**
This case study explains how **Service A** and **Service B** interact with each other, focusing on transactional boundaries, threading models, failure handling, and recovery. It also includes details about the **Docker Compose** setup used for running both services together.

---

## **Service A**
### **Purpose**
Acts as the **entry point** for user requests. It manages the overall workflow by coordinating with **Service B**.

### **Key Features**
- **Transactional Boundaries**: Uses an **H2 in-memory database** to track request states (`INITIATED`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`). It follows a **choreography-based Saga pattern**, meaning it triggers compensation if something goes wrong in Service B.
- **Threading Model**:
  - Runs on **Tomcat** (supports up to **200 threads**) to handle incoming requests.
  - Uses an **async thread pool (10-50 threads, queue size 100)** for calling Service B without blocking other requests.
  - If the thread pool is full, it applies a **CallerRunsPolicy**, ensuring no request is dropped.
- **Failure Handling**:
  - Implements **Resilience4j** for **retries and circuit breakers** when calling Service B.
  - If Service B fails, it logs the failure and retries.
  - If the issue persists, it queues compensation and periodically retries (every 5 minutes).
- **Recovery**:
  - On startup, it checks incomplete transactions (`INITIATED`) and attempts recovery.
  - Calls **Service Bâ€™s status endpoint** (`/status/{requestId}`) to avoid re-processing completed requests.
- **Docker Setup**:
  - Runs on **port 7080**.
  - Uses environment variables to configure **H2 database** and **Service Bâ€™s URL (`http://service-b:7081`)**.

## **Service B**
### **Purpose**
Processes requests sent by **Service A** and supports **compensation** if needed.

### **Key Features**
- **Transactional Boundaries**: Uses an **H2 database** to maintain its own **TransactionLog** (`INITIATED`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`, `COMPENSATED`).
- **Threading Model**:
  - Runs on **Tomcat** (**200 max threads**) for request handling.
  - Uses an **async thread pool (5-20 threads, queue size 50)** for recovery tasks.
  - Applies **CallerRunsPolicy** to ensure requests are not dropped.
- **Failure Handling**:
  - Uses **Spring Retry (`@Retryable`)** for transient failures (e.g., database issues).
  - If compensation is needed, it notifies **Service A** (`/notify-compensation`).
- **Recovery**:
  - Checks for **incomplete transactions (`INITIATED`)** every **6 minutes** and recovers them.
- **Docker Setup**:
  - Runs on **port 7081**.
  - Provides API endpoints:
    - `/api/serviceB/process`: Processes requests from Service A.
    - `/api/compensation/{requestId}`: Handles compensation for failed transactions.

## **How Service A & B Work Together**
Think of this system like ordering food online:

1. **User places an order** (`req123`):
   - Service A logs **INITIATED** and sends a request to Service B.
   - It does this asynchronously (doesnâ€™t wait for a response).

2. **Service B processes the order**:
   - Logs **INITIATED**, completes the work, and updates the log to **SUCCESS**.
   - Responds to Service A with confirmation.

3. **Service A marks the order as complete**:
   - Logs **SUCCESS** and notifies the user that the order is ready.

---

## **Handling Failures**

### **1. What if Service B is down?**
- Service A retries multiple times.
- If still down, it logs **FAILED** and queues compensation.
- Once Service B is back, Service A retries processing or cancels the request.

### **2. What if Service A crashes?**
- When restarted, Service A checks its logs.
- If an order is stuck at **INITIATED**, it asks Service B:
  - If Service B says **SUCCESS**, Service A updates its log.
  - If Service B also failed, Service A retries or compensates.

### **3. What if Service B fails mid-process?**
- Service B logs **FAILED** and triggers compensation.
- It notifies Service A (if notification is enabled).
- Service A then updates its log accordingly.

---

## **Docker Compose Setup**
- Both services run in a **single network (`app-network`)**.
- Service A depends on Service B (`depends_on: service-b`).
- Docker builds JARs using **Maven (`mvn package`)** and copies them into containers.
- Uses **wildcards (`target/*.jar`)** to handle different build names dynamically.

## **Summary Flow Diagram**
```
User --> Service A (port 7080)
  |--> Log: INITIATED
  |--> Async Call --> Service B (port 7081)
        |--> Log: INITIATED
        |--> Process --> Log: SUCCESS
  |<-- Response: SUCCESS
  |--> Log: SUCCESS
  |--> User: "Order done!"
```

#### **Failure Example:**
```
User --> Service A
  |--> Log: INITIATED
  |--> Call Service B (down)
  |--> Retry/Fallback --> Log: FAILED
  |--> Queue Compensation
  |--> Recovery --> Retry or Compensate
```

This ensures that even if **one service fails, the system remains reliable and recovers gracefully**.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
This setup ensures:
âœ… Orders (requests) are processed smoothly.
âœ… No requests are lost, even in failures.
âœ… Services run independently but coordinate efficiently.
âœ… Docker Compose makes deployment easy.

You can start everything with **one command**, and the system will take care of failures, retries, and recovery automatically!

ðŸš€ **Happy coding!**
